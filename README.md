This project is no longer supported or functional. Originally designed to export the work schedule from Walmart One (circa 2017) to Google Calendar.
-  WMO has since changed their interface, thus requiring a change in the underlying code, which is __NOT__ possible since I am no longer employed by Walmart.
  -  Unless someone want's to provide me with their WMO login, I am unable to help you.
-  No license required; as far as I am concerned, this project is deprecated, useless even. Please do not contact me regard this project, it is deprecated! I am no longer associated with it's production!
  - Last I checked, only the Linux version is live.
